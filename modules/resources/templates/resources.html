                        <h2>What is ATT&amp;CK?</h2>
                        <p>
                            ATT&amp;CK is knowledge base of adversarial techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&amp;CK focuses on how adversaries interact with systems during an operation, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target.

                                ATT&CK is a model that attempts to systematically categorize adversary behavior. The main components of the model are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong><a href="/tactics">Tactics</a></strong>, represents “why” or the reason an adversary is performing an action

                                        <strong><a href="/techniques">Techniques</a></strong>, represents “how” adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing an action
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Sub-techniques</strong>, a more specific or lower-level description of adversarial behavior
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Procedures</strong>, specific implementation or in-the-wild use the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                ATT&CK is organized in a series of technology domains, the ecosystem an adversary operates within. Currently, there are three <strong>technology</strong> domains:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong><a href="matrices/mobile/">Mobile</a></strong> for mobile communication devices
                                    </li>

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                Within each domain are <strong>platforms</strong>, which may be an operating system or application (e.g. Microsoft Windows). Techniques and sub-techniques can apply to multiple platforms.

                        ATT&amp;CK is just as much about the mindset and process of using it as much as it is the knowledge base itself. When it comes to information security, the threats we face, new technologies, and the adaptability of goal-based adversaries, we cannot consider filling out a checklist as “done”.

                                Don’t shout “Bingo” when you have one technique. Just because you have identified a single way an adversary has done a technique, doesn’t mean it’s time to declare success and color a box green. Adversaries have multiple ways they can perform most techniques. Look for and understand other ways a technique may be accomplished.

                                Don’t limit yourself to the matrix. Remember the ATT&CK matrix only documents observed real-world behaviors. Adversaries may have a series of other behaviors they use that have not been documented yet. To get a full picture of threats your organization faces, (1) Leverage your own intelligence sources, (2) create and document your own observed techniques, and (3) don’t limit yourselves to behaviors, a timely indicator can catch an adversary.
